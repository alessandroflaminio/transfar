# Transfar

## Introduction

Transfar is a tool for sharing files between PCs on the same LAN. It was born as a project for an university course, so it is not indended to be a completely reliable tool.

## Disclaimer

Right now the app is not using a secure transport protocol, so all the data exchanged within the app is not encrypted and could be easily sniffed by someone on your LAN. Said that, I'm not responsible for any damage that could be caused by the misusage of Transfar.
